Hello World Wide Web,

I'm a final year PhD student at the University of York, and this is my
website.

You'll probably find posts on [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org), which looks
like this:


```{haskell}
    map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
    map f []     = []
    map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

Or alternatively, you'll see posts about making bread, which is my current
fascination.

Bio
===

I am a Research Scientist at [Galois, Inc.](https://www.galois.com)
working mostly on Quantitative Information Flow and Abstract Interpretation.

I have just finished my [PhD thesis](http://jmct.cc/thesis.html). I conducted
the research as a member of the Programming Languages group at the 
[University of York Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk).
My thesis focused on parallelism in Functional Programming languages using
the combination of static analysis and runtime profiling.

My research interests are in parallel functional languages, DSLs, computer music
(particularly the representation and manipulation of structures representing
rhythm), and compilers.

Education

Prior to that I studied at [University of Miami](http://www.miami.edu) in their
wonderful [MUE program](http://mue.music.miami.edu/)

* BS in Music Engineering Technology with
    * Minor in Electrical Engineering

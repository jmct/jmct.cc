Bio
===

I have just finished my [PhD thesis](http://jmct.cc/thesis.html). I conducted
the research as a member of the Programming Languages group at the 
[University of York Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk).
My research focuses on parallelism in Functional Programming languages.
I have particular interest in implicit parallelism and static analysis.

At some point they'll ask me to
[defend](https://www.vitae.ac.uk/doing-research/doing-a-doctorate/completing-your-doctorate/your-viva)
the thesis and (hopefully) make some
[corrections](https://www.vitae.ac.uk/doing-research/doing-a-doctorate/completing-your-doctorate/your-viva/thesis-outcomes),
but until then I'm not technically finished!

I now work at [Galois](http://www.galois.com) as part of their Washington DC
office.

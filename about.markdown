Bio
===

I am currently the Executive Director of the [Haskell
Foundation](https://haskell.foundation) and finishing up a Lecturship at the
[University of Maryland](https://cs.umd.edu).  Previously I was a Research
Scientist at [Galois, Inc.](https://www.galois.com) working mostly on
Quantitative Information Flow and Abstract Interpretation.

I completed my [PhD](http://jmct.cc/thesis.html) as a member of the Programming
Languages group at the [University of York Computer Science
Department](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk).  My thesis focused on parallelism in
Functional Programming languages using the combination of static analysis and
runtime profiling.

My research interests are in parallel functional languages, DSLs, computer
music, and compilers.
